Matrix Assignment
=================

By now, you've heard Dr. Gomprecht's lecture on matrices, which can be found
here. (INSERT LINK). Matrices, as he told you, have many different uses and
applications both in math and science. In fact, many of you will use matrices
in physics later in the year in order to solve systems of equations.

As with the last assignment, Dr. Gomprecht has already scaffolded some of the
code for you. He has a list of methods that he wants your class to include. In
addition, you should work to create some of your own test classes in order to
test your matrices.

This assignment can seem very daunting at first. Before you decide what
instructions you want to give your computer, you have to determine how you
would manipulate a matrix first. So, we recommend that you start by trying to
modify a few different matrices into the identity matrix.
